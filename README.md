# MIDI_foot_controller
This is the subjective project for creating the MIDI_foot_controller using an Arduino micropro board and https://github.com/tttapa/MIDI_controller library - a great library for creating a MIDI controllers using an Arduino boards.  
This library has been obsoleted by its successor, the [**Control Surface**](https://github.com/tttapa/Control-Surface) library but for this particular project (foot controler) it was enough.
